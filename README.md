# odin-landing-page
Odin Project Landing page focusing on CSS

Took me just over three weeks to create this html and css page. Learnt plenty about flexbox and general design along the way.

Images credit to Freepik and Flaticon. Found the cool cartoon images there and the symbols. Attribution link: <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/socrates" title="socrates icons">Socrates icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>

Quotes of course attributed to the philosophers that said them, but they're dead and probably don't care about attribution, unless they're spiteful in death in which case fight me (but not at night please thanks I get scared).

Please let me know if there's anything I can improve upon, or you just wanna share your perspective that's fine too. Thanks!
